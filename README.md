NATIONAL PROGRAMMING CONTEST 
In Kenya,motorists often find themselves stranded on highways with no nearbyrepair shops or mechanics in sight. To address this challenge, a group of computersoftware developers has come together for a hackathon aimed at creating solutionsto assist stranded motorists. They have decided to develop three differentplatforms: a mobile app, a web app, and a basic website, all under the umbrellaname "Rescue Roadside Assistance." Through these three platforms-mobile app,web app, and basic website - Rescue Roadside Assistance aims to connectstranded motorists with reliable mechanics efficiently, ensuring prompt assistanceduring emergencies on Kenyan highways. The challenges faced by motorists haveinformed the theme of this year's national programming contest being“Innovation in Tech: Building the Future.”
This Programming Contest seeks to nurture ideas and immediate technologysolutions developed by the youth based on Mobile apps, Web Applications andwebsites that can help address challenges faced by motorists, particularly in remoteareas, by providing seamless access to reliable roadside assistance services,ultimately enhancing road safety and convenience for all travelers in Kenya.
Contestants are therefore expected to develop innovative software solutions oftheir choice to solve real-world problems for the areas specitied for each category.

# Category 2:Web Applications
The web app will offer similar functionalities as the mobile app but will beaccessible through web browsers on desktop and laptop computers. Here's ascenario for the web app:

# Category 3: Basic Website
The basic website will serve as a simplified version of the web app,providing essential information and contact details of registered mechanics.Here's a scenario for the basic website:
· A motorist whose car breaks down on the highway searches for nearbymechanics using their smartphone browser.
·They come across the Rescue Roadside Assistance basic website,whichlists mechanics sorted by location.
